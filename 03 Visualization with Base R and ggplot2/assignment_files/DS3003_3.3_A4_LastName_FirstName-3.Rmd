# Instructions

- This is an individual assignment. *Submit your `.Rmd` and "knitted"`.html` files through Collab.*

- Upload your `html` file on [RPubs](https://rpubs.com) and include the link when you submit your submission files on Collab. 

- Please don't use `ggplot2` for this assignment. We'll use `ggplot2` almost all the times after this assignment. 

# Part 1 

- Use the occupational experience variable (“oexp”) of the income_example dataset and plot
 
  + a histogram, 
  + a kernel density estimate, 
  + a boxplot of “oexp”, 
  + a set of boxplots showing the distribution of “oexp” by sex crossed with occupational status (“occ”). 
 
- You can either produce four separate but small plots, or you can use par(`mfrow = c(2, 2)`) to create a plotting region consisting of four subplots. 

- **Briefly describe the distributions** of occupational experience in words (also include your plots and the R syntax).


[“Play” with the `hist()` and `density()` functions; for instance, by choosing a different number of bins or different break points for the `hist()` function, or different bandwidths using the adjust argument in `density()`. See also the corresponding help files and the examples given there. Only include the histogram and density estimate you find most informative. Also, add useful axis-labels and a title using the following arguments inside the plotting functions: `xlab, ylab, main`. Use the help `?par()` for the description of many more plotting parameter.]

[That’s how the plots could look like – but you have to do it with your group;-)]

```{r}
# add your codes
```

- *describe your plots.*


# Part 2

- Download the SCS Data set from Collab (there you also find a separate file containing a brief description of variables). Then investigate the relationship between the mathematics achievement score (“mathpre”) and the math anxiety score (“mars”) by plotting the data and the path of means. 

(i) Produce a scatterplot between “mathpre” and “mars”. You might consider using `jitter()` or `alpha()` for avoiding overlying points.

```{r}
# add your codes
```

(ii) Draw a conditioning plot for female and male students (variable “male”). Include “` | male `” in your first argument to create a conditioning plot.
```{r}
# add your codes
```

(iii) Describe in words the relation between math scores and math anxiety. Do you find evidence of Simpson's Paradox? 

*describe your plots.*


# Part 3

- Use a dataset that is available in data repositories (e.g., [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)) 

- Briefly describe the dataset you're using (e.g., means to access data, context, sample, variables, etc...)
  
   + *describe your data.*
   
- Re-do **Part 2**, i.e., 
   + produce a scatterplot between “A” and “B”. You might consider using `jitter()` or `alpha()` for avoiding overlying points.
   + draw a scatterplot plot conditioning on variable “C”. Include “` | C `” in your first argument to create a conditioning plot.
   + describe in words the relation between "A" and "B." Do you find evidence of Simpson's Paradox?

```{r}
# add your codes
```

- You will **present results** of Part 3 to your neighbor(s) in class of **Jan. 7 (Mon)**.
